# Brave Sync Server v2

A sync server implemented in go to communicate with Brave sync clients using
[components/sync/protocol/sync.proto](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/sync/protocol/sync.proto).
Current Chromium version for sync protocol buffer files used in this repo is Chromium 88.0.4324.96.

This server supports endpoints as bellow.
- The `POST /v2/command/` endpoint handles Commit and GetUpdates requests from sync clients and return corresponding responses both in protobuf format. Detailed of requests and their corresponding responses are defined in `schema/protobuf/sync_pb/sync.proto`. Sync clients are responsible for generating valid access tokens and present them to the server in the Authorization header of requests.

Currently we use dynamoDB as the datastore, the schema could be found in `schema/dynamodb/table.json`.
